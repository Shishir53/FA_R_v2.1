											<h3>My Shoe Laces</h3>
											<p>On my foot, over the shoe

												Today I tied my laces, and it went free again.
												
												Like holding your memories, with lots of "if" and "but" in my brain.
												
												Talking of you and love,
												
												My heart gets cornered again.
												
												When the sun rises and office should be attained,
												
												I walk through the park and my laces gets entertained.
												
												It's like you held my hand on stairs not to fall and me…. just to fall again.
												
												The moment you smile,your laces stuck in bushes,
												
												Body hit the ground and your smile is joined by pain.
												
												Once again you stand and decide the story will not remain the same,
												
												With efforts, Your Day goes well but by the night you know... it's not your game.
												
												Because when sun kisses the sea, you fall for it and heart takes over your brain.
												
												"Shishir", Everyday I smile and tie up my thoughts well with sun rising again,
												
												But by the night my laces are free... to make me fall, so the story remains the same.
												
												-By the way, my laces are rebellious by nature ;)
												
												Happy Readings.</p>

											<h3>Fall in Love, again</h3>
											<p>Sometimes I pray to fall …..in love again

												And often I fear of the same,
												
												What if you forget me
												
												And change the surname.
												
												Only God knows the depth of
												
												sea of love in my heart,
												
												like me on the surface of existence
												
												he is a floating dead man.
												
												Perhaps,
												
												I'm ready to be burned alive
												
												In your love, if one spares my heart
												
												On your command.
												
												Closer we get, deeper we fall
												
												Not bound to egdes or body's state,
												
												It's gravity ….keeps you down
												
												With fights as friction, drives straight.
												
												love is like entropy of universe,
												
												It’s character, grows randomly
												
												and seems really insane.
												
												If love hits me again,
												
												It should make fall you first
												
												Then meet me this time
												
												but only with your name.
												
												I want my life to crawl out
												
												through the window of love,
												
												To see her maester..like a dream
												
												With a Smile.... Holding your hand.
												
												-From the place with your nameplate,
												
												Which is mine but miss you more.

										<h3>Introduction</h3>
										<p>This page is created for original content only. Intention behind this is simple to share some of my original content and few other writer's work as well, whch I have found intersting.
										Due to my interest in politics and long term policy makings of our country, let's say in beurocracy , I will voice my opinion every now and then. It's not necessary to doso, there is no intention to get some monetary benefits form this.
										It's more like <i>'Cool lag rha tha to kar liya'</i>. I will share things very soon, it's just start of setting up this site.
										May God bless you all with spare time and enthusiasm because both would be needed to go through these many posts.
										Ha ha ha.... B bye.
