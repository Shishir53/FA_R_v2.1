    <h2 id="content">Keep It Simple.</h2>
    <p>"we should wrap it now and end our story Ani."</p>
    <p>Ani never forgot that day. All those lines, her voice, that smile after every childish act despite of being most intelligent girl he ever met.</p>
    <p>A lot of pears was there in their beads of memories. But the thread was meant to be broken.</p>
    <p>As a child he struggled in remembering things in his early days and worked hard to get a strong memory. but now that child has grown to be an adult and want to outrun his strong memory by forgetting everything. Life has welcomed him finally but certainly not in best way.</p>
    <p>After almost 3 years He was again there. Sitting on 5th floor inside food court, he was very nervous today. With the same increased pace of heart beat he was playing with his all time favorite pen, which was a gift to him from Payal on his 20th B’day. The menu card was lying on the table. Perhaps he was thinking if her taste was also changed with time.</p>
    <p>“Then what should I order. hmmm…… Let’s play safe, I will ask her to order. In fact this is what a gentlemen does.”
        Definitely with time he has got this habit of talking to himself.
        “that’s even better then” ,he answered himself.</p>
    <p>Then he heard that familiar pattern of heel’s sound. With delay of 5 mins she came. For a sec he wished to look at her face for once but it was way more difficult for him now. The waiter came and took the order.</p>
    <p>“काफ़ी अच्छी लग रही हो.” , Breaking that long standing silence of 5 mins between them, he said.</p>
    <p>“Do you like my sandals” she asked. He smiled.</p>
    <p>‘No, tell me seriously’ she asked again “I think you want them to take home actually”.
        “you have been constantly looking on my feet and you are telling me this. Not even for once you have looked above. What’s wrong with you. We are meeting after 2 years and you are behaving like a 5 yr old child. ” She was not happy at all.</p>
    <p>“okay then, here we go.” He thought and pointed towards her head for that vermilion.</p>
    <p>“What?”, she was surprised. “You know I’m married now. And a married woman is supposed to wear it right? ”. still he was looking down, sitting at other side of the table. “Look up and talk to me. Otherwise, I’m leaving”. She has been this way all the time. It wasn’t new for him and he knew by his experiences that she meant her words.</p>
    <p>“That reminds me that you are married to someone else now. that makes me feel sad” he has always been honest with her.</p>
    <p>“Look into my eyes, I’m sitting in front of you. Don’t look left and right and accept the truth. I’m married now and I can’t do much. That’s it from my side. You need to move on, as soon as possible”. She commanded him as always. “I can’t believe it Ani. It has been 3 years now, I thought you would have moved on. Now, Look into my eyes and talk to me”.</p>
    <p>“I Love You” while looking into her eyes he said.</p>
    <p>“Oh God, Ani, please don’t start it again. Look, I know you still have feelings for me but once you meet someone else, you will be fine. We can still be friends and help each other in ups and downs of our life”.</p>
    <p>He said nothing. He was still looking into her eyes. May be he was acting childish but he was matured enough to know the truth of life. “It’s basic truth that not even one in hundred be your just friend if he/she has feelings for you. No, it’s not possible in any condition. So it’s more like a fact.
        If you are not taking time to talk to your friends, you will become the killer of your friendship sooner or later. But you can be exempted if you are one of 210 presidents running your country single handily.
        Have you heard about priorities? Right, you got my point”.</p>
    <p>While having dinner they were silent and Animesh was again talking to himself.
        “If we aren’t even talking properly how will we come to know what is happening in each other’s life” He wanted to ask but he didn’t. “ If you aren’t replying him then obviously you don’t want to. It’s your choice, your decision. Say it aloud on my face, keep things simple. That is how you killed our relationship 3 years ago. By not talking at all. Everybody has a person to whom he/she shares his problem, and for you if I’m not that guy. Then I’m no one. I’m just like any other guy for you. One of those guys who has a crush on you. Yes , it’s complicated like hell. That’s why I’m asking you to keep it simple. It wasn’t a big deal for you, when another guy approached you and told you about his feelings for you. For you it was another guy, another story. but you made a mess of it. yes you said ‘no’ to him but not a ‘strict no’. you shared your personal and emotional stuffs with him. You shared even me. you kept talking to him despite of me warning about him. reminding you of be aware of him. In the end you made him another so called ‘friend’ of yours. he was happy obviously because he got a emotional dustbin. A dustbin where he will dump all his emotion, which he has for you. As the days increased he was more hopeful of having you at his own side one day. And you being so good girl were spoiling yourself by complicating another relationship. It wasn’t all his fault, you were the one who gave hope to him by keeping him in contact. You asked him not to enter your heart but gave him a soft corner. In the end obviously you was frustrated of him and stopped talking to him. But till then the damage was already done. Due to human nature one always love attractions and appraisals and but in the end of the day, you were trapped in them and that was your fault. During all these I opposed your every action,yes i judged you and tried my best to stop you only to spoil my own relationship in attempt of saving you from another mess. yes, I was Jealous. I was jealous because I knew his intentions. Because I knew i’m loosing you and you are too good to know all these. Yes, I was wrong at some moments and you have no idea how much angry I was on myself for that. I have cried days for that”.
        “I’m just asking to keep it simple.” He thought but he knew it wasn’t possible for her.</p>
    <p>So he stood up, kissed her on forehead and said “Sorry, I can’t be just friend with you and I don’t want you to be my emotional dustbin. Let’s keep things simple. Like you said once, let’s Cut the crap. Goodbye. Have a happy married life ahead”.</p>
    <p>But she was too good to understand all these.<br>
        He paid his part of bill and left her unlike others, to make her life easy and simple.The 24 years old guy had much older maturity.
        
        <br>He left her after almost 3 years of their breakup.</p>

                <li>Your every action is a decision. Think once before you do anything.</li>
                <li>The life demands you to be very specific and to keep it simple.</li>
                <li>Be afraid of people who attracts you with their beautiful words. They are most dangerous people on earth.</li>
