    <h2>My Mess</h2>
    <p>A sight ...So bright,<br/>
        Without light....In darkest night.<br/>
        Barking shadow....Like swimming kite,<br/>
        Been To and from .....Nothing seems right.<br/>
        candle of dreams.....Burning inside,<br/>
        A little hope.....but then Why My jeans is so tight.<br>
        So much noise around And chaos of fight,<br>
        Let me drive through this hell<br>
        For once... let me land the flight.<br>
        No promise of staying alive<br>
        But swear to beat the time,<br>
        Let me end this battle<br>
        Before that candle burns out.<br>
        That jeans ...wearing often<br>
        Not a fit.... not even mine,<br>
        Being in wrong place<br>
        Saw six in every nine.<br>
        so beautiful that coloured eyes<br>
        Showing love to me...was enough to fright,<br>
        Dear, Kill me for once and all...<br>
        Do not murder me every night.<br></p>

    <h2>Know Me - See through my eyes</h2>
    <p>To know me more … ..<br/>
        Wear my shoes,<br/>
        Borrow my eyes and<br/>
        Have some sleepless nights,<br/>
        Make smile the crowd<br/>
        But cry alone sometimes.<br/>
        See your dreams drifting away<br/>
        Give up every time...only<br/>
        to pick up yourself next day.<br/>
        Listen a song again n again<br/>
        For many days but forget the lines,<br/>
        Learn to call,care,love and all<br/>
        Do everything <i>'Shishir'</i>....<br/>
        ....But at wrong times...(1)<br/></p>
        <p>
        Take some time out of your life<br/>
        For few days.. borrow my eyes,<br/>
        Feel a night having sunshine<br/>
        Darkness coming out of lights,<br/>
        Watch burning a house you built<br/>
        And people just passing by.<br/>
        Work for haters,take some wrong turns,<br/>
        love to be depressed, Die for nothing..<br/>
        Just Be dead but please stay alive.<br/>
        To be nowhere....<br/>
        That's how.... I have walked miles...(2)<br/></p>
